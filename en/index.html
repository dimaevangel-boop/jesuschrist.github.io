(Carefully and with Great Joy!)</p>

            <p><span class=handwrittenText>The coldness of this world,</span>&nbsp the offspring of darkness, which draws strength from the emptiness of the heart, which is not occupied by Love: indifference, anger, envy, deceit, contempt, pride, cruelty, selfishness, ingratitude, hypocrisy, dishonesty, betrayal!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>All of this is overcome by </span><span class=handwrittenTextLight>Love!</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Love</span>&nbsp is <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>the Primal Light</span>&nbsp that precedes the Universe, the Beginning and Cause of All that exists!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Just as water and oil</span>&nbsp do not mix, just as light dispels darkness, so <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Love</span>&nbsp forces out all evil!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>A person</span>&nbsp who lacks Love is like a neglected, plundered, broken building that was once a temple and where wild beasts and ravens have settled!</p>

            <p><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>The Purity of Love:</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Merciful and Kind,</span>&nbsp Love forgives what causes wounds, and does not return evil for evil, does not envy, does not boast, but is gentle and serves Its neighbors with Joy (for such is Its <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>bright</span>&nbsp nature!), is not haughty, not malicious, does not devise evil, but is meek, modest and kind, does not seek Its own, but sincerely and devotedly seeks the Good for others, not prone to anger, but patient as much as necessary, does not rejoice in evil, but rejoices in Good, selflessly devoted, faithful, Eternal, in all respects unearthly: never fails, never betrays, never weakens, hopes all things and <span class=handwrittenText>endures all things!</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>(Purest</span>&nbsp of all in the world, Gentle <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Light:</span>&nbsp Kind and Merciful, Sensitive, Caring, Affectionate, Sincere and Joyful!<span class=handwrittenText>)</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Love's</span><span class=handwrittenText> Own beauty:</span>&nbsp The Well-Being of Its Beloved! (Like a <span class=handwrittenTextRed>blooming garden,</span>&nbsp and man's task is to care for it!)</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Each of us</span>&nbsp is created in the Image of God, as a child of God, to have God's Greatest Ability: <span class=handwrittenTextLight>to Love!</span>&nbsp To understand that caring for others is Joy, that honesty is more precious than diamonds, this is what it means to be in the image of God! The very nature of God Himself: <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>to sincerely Love!</span>&nbsp "Love not in word only, but in deed and truth!" - the Bible urges. <span class=handwrittenText>Value</span>&nbsp others, cherish your neighbors, take care of your Beloved, show mercy to your enemies! <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Love</span>&nbsp your neighbors at least as much as yourself, and in fact even more!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>After all, </span><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Love</span><span class=handwrittenText> is Selfless,</span>&nbsp does not seek Its own, but seeks Good for others! <span class=handwrittenText>Happiness</span>&nbsp is the Happiness of the Beloved!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>(Love</span>&nbsp is like that <span class=handwrittenTextSkyBlue>*snowflake*,</span>&nbsp gives itself completely! (But not fragile, but Invincible!)<span class=handwrittenText>)</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>One of</span>&nbsp the most amazing properties of Love: It is more blessed to give than to receive! <span class=handwrittenText>(And therein lies Its Irresistible Gentleness</span>&nbsp and <span class=handwrittenText>Its Sweetness</span> that touches the depths of the soul!<span class=handwrittenText>)</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>This is the nature of Love:</span>&nbsp to be Happy when doing Good! (And this is the beauty of God's children, who act according to the good desire of a Loving, sensitive heart!)</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>This is the nature of Love:</span>&nbsp to put the interests of your Beloved above your own (sincerely and without ulterior motives)! <span class=handwrittenText>(Because</span>&nbsp Love is about Dedication <span class=handwrittenText>*with all of your heart*!)</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>(Everyone</span>&nbsp who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted!<span class=handwrittenText>)</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>One of</span>&nbsp the most amazing Powers of Love is Inexhaustible Forgiveness! (Just as God Himself has enveloped the whole world in His forgiveness!)</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Know</span>&nbsp that no one can take anything from this life into eternity — except our Beloved ones! That is why Love is so important, and that our values are correct! Everything you have physically is replaceable! Your Loved ones are irreplaceable! This is what God teaches us: <span class=handwrittenText>to Love our close ones!</span>&nbsp This is what God teaches us: to be a support for our close ones, a healing for the wounded, a comfort for the oppressed, a gentle ray of <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Light</span>&nbsp and warmth so needed by this needy world!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>(Like the design of bird wings</span>&nbsp — to be in the sky, the human heart — in the Eternal, Brighter than the sky, Perfect Love of God!<span class=handwrittenText>)</span></p>

            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Words-attributes</span>&nbsp that are like <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>diamond dust,</span>&nbsp that describe Love: <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Selfless Devotion, Kindness, Faithfulness, Honesty, Patience, Caring, Sincerity, Sensitivity, Unconditionality, Purity, Eternity, Mercy, Forgiveness, Gentleness, Joy, Gratitude, Humility, Modesty, Attention, Compassion, Self-giving, Appreciation of others, Complete Dedication, Responsiveness, Tenderness, Sweetness!</span>&nbsp (The Fullness of All That Is Good and Pure!)</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>(Because</span>&nbsp we are created in <span class=handwrittenTextLight>the Image of God,</span>&nbsp we understand all these so signficant, <span class=handwrittenText>Fundamental</span>&nbsp words!<span class=handwrittenText>)</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>The Love</span>&nbsp bestowed by God into the heart is greater than this world, just as the sun is greater than the flower it nourishes!</p>

            <p><span class=handwrittenTextLightBright>Love,</span>&nbsp Majestic and Higher than Heaven, is the greatest testimony of God: an amazing, undeniably luxurious design from the One Who created Everything that exists!</p>

Адже Сам Ісус Полюбив Своїх ворогів і молився за тих, хто кривдили Його і розіп’яли Його, а деякі кидали жереб щодо Його верхнього одягу! Любов Божа Милосердна, Терпляча, Чесна!</p>

            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Церква</span>&nbsp названа нареченою Ісуса, бо відносини між чоловіком і дружиною мають бути найчистішими в світі, взірцем чесності, щирості, самовідданості, цілковитої лагідності і доброти, їхня <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Любов</span>&nbsp одне до одного сильніша за все, що у світі, і <span class=handwrittenText>Вічна!</span>&nbsp Бог, Сам Добрий і Чулий, не терпить розлучення (<a href="https://www.bible.com/uk/bible/1755/MAT.19.4-9">Матвія, 19:4-9</a>), а створив одного чоловіка і одну жінку одне для до одного на все життя (два Лю&#769бих <span class="basicTextDescribed" data-tooltip-text="Термін із фізики: елементарні частинки, поєднані дуже сильною взаємодією">кварки</span> наче, які не можуть бути одне без одного!), заклавши в кожне серце те, що має Сам: лагідність і чулість, і прямодушність (чесність), і беззбройність (довіру всім своїм серцем), і здатність <span class=handwrittenTextLight>беззавітно Любити,</span>&nbsp не очікуючи собі, а даруючи іншому з Радістю! (І навіть просто бути зі своєю обраною чи обраним в одному світі, це і вже є <span class=handwrittenTextLight>Радість!</span>&nbsp Сам Небесний Батько тримає закоханих за руку і Любов долає всі труднощі життя, і відстань, і всі випробування, бо все, що може породити цей світ — солома у порівнянні з тим, що <span class=handwrittenTextLight>Боже</span>&nbsp і <span class=handwrittenTextLight>від Бога!</span>)</p>

			<p><span class=handwrittenText>Промовив </span><span class=handwrittenTextLight>Ісус:</span>&nbsp Блаженніше давати ніж приймати! (І <nobr>це —</nobr> одна з найдивовижніших властивостей <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Любові!</span>&nbsp)</p>

			<p><span class=handwrittenText>Сам </span><span class=handwrittenTextLightBright>Бог</span><span class=handwrittenText> дбайливо поєднує людські серця,</span>&nbsp пов'язуючи силою, Найвеличнішою в світі; узи <nobr>шлюбу —</nobr> священні, непорушні для Нього! Христа і Церкву розділяла смерть, як теменна зловісна безодня (через людський гріх, який заважав людині бути у повноцінній присутності Божій), та <span class=handwrittenTextLight>Любов</span><span class=handwrittenText> дужча за смерть:</span>&nbsp Він через смерть Свою переміг смерть, Своєю <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Чистою Беззавітною Святою Любов'ю</span>&nbsp розсіяв володіння темряви і знищив владу смерті, викупивши людство безперечною ціною Свого безгрішного, присвяченого, відданого нам і Небесному Батькові життя!</p>

			<p><span class=handwrittenText>Так і кожний чоловік </span><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Любить</span>&nbsp свою дружину (більше за себе!), ставлячись до неї бережливо, як до тендітної, безцінної кришталевої вази надзвичайної ексклюзивної ручної роботи, а дружина <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Любить</span>&nbsp і поважає свого чоловіка, і ніщо у Всесвіті не має роз'єднати те, що Святими узами поєднав Сам Бог! Бо <nobr>людина —</nobr> прямий образ Божий, а <nobr>Бог —</nobr> <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Сама Довершена, Вічна, Віддана Безмежно Любов!</span>&nbsp Бог бажає Любов: Турботливу, Вірну, Жертовну, що радше потерпить Сама, ніж скривдить іншого, Чисту, Лагідну, Сумирну, Безкорисливу! Люди роблять помилки, але Сам Бог виправляє відносини, бо Любить Своїх дітей!</p>
			
            <p><span class=handwrittenTextLightBright>Ісус</span>&nbsp є Сином, що <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Любить</span>&nbsp і шанує Свого Батька, а тому кожна людина, що є Образом Божим і має змогу називатися Дитиною Божою, має шанувати батьків, а батьки Любити своїх дітей. Цей закон більш фундаментальний ніж гравітація і електромагнетизм!</p>
			
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Найкращий дарунок від Творця до творіння, </span><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Сама Любов</span>&nbsp — це про те, як дарувати cебе іншим!</p>
            
			<p><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Любов</span><span class=handwrittenText> не шукає власного, а шукає Добра для Любимих!</span>&nbsp</p>
			
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Бо </span><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Любов</span>&nbsp не шукає власного, Вона не шукає власного щастя! <nobr>Щастя —</nobr> це Щастя Любимих! Любов Щаслива, бо чинить Добро безоплатно! Любов Щаслива, бо це робить Щасливим ближніх!</p>

            <p><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Любов</span>&nbsp не може бути тільки до Бога чи тільки до людини. Чим сильніше людина Любить Бога, тим сильніше вона Любить людину, яка створена Богом! Чим сильніше людина Любить людину, тим сильніше вона Любить Бога, Який її створив! (<a href="https://www.bible.com/uk/bible/1755/1JN.5.1-2">1 Івана, 5:1-2</a>)</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>І у цьому</span>&nbsp — на вічні віки <span class=handwrittenTextLight>Богові</span><span class=handwrittenText> Хвала!</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Любов</span>&nbsp — це гаряча течія, що тримає на плаву цей корабель, жбурляємий вітром, що називається світом!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Там, де наше серце, там і наш скарб!</span>&nbsp</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Здобувайте Боже Царство, а все інше додасться!</span>&nbsp</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Природне наповнення кожного серця, як задумане </span><span class=handwrittenTextLight>Богом: Любов!</span></p>
					
			<p><span class=handwrittenTextLight>Любов Вічна!</span></p>

            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Бог заповідав,</span>&nbsp щоби ми згадували жертву Ісуса, і збиралися разом, приймаючи хліб і плід виноградної лози, як символи Його тіла, що постраждало за нас, і крові, пролитої за нас!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Віруючі,</span>&nbsp не приходьте до Бога (у храм, дім молитви) тільки на свята! Майте за звичку зустрічатись із Богом разом, як родиною, регулярно!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Тому ми, Церква Христова,</span>&nbsp збираємося щонеділі, щоби провести час разом, згадуючи жертву Бога і прославляючи Його словами і піснями, і плодами нашої Любові, бо Бог, Який Полюбив нас настільки, що поклав Свою душу, дарував нам одне одного і безкорисливо дав життя, заслуговує на Всю Хвалу!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Бог заповідав</span>&nbsp хреститися кожному віруючому, бо <nobr>хрещення —</nobr> це вкладання завіту з Богом, погоджуючись, що Бог бере на Себе всі його гріхи, і що людина від нині від щирого серця прагнутиме жити по-Божому: у Любові і Світлі, і бути прикладом для всіх, як сяюче Світло, рятівне і незгасне, своїм добрим життям наче графіт на діамант перетвореним (коли Полюбив і свої добрі справи явив)!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>(Заклик до віруючих:)</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Віруючі,</span>&nbsp перебувайте в Любові! Навіть якщо (і особливо якщо!) світ іде вниз, людські серця холоднішають і байдужість охоплює світ, кожний із нас має лишатися Світлом, що сяє в цій темряві як цілюще листя, щоби кожний бачив в нас Бога і зцілювався, а ті, що ненавидять <nobr>нас —</nobr> предмет наших молитв, щоби серця їхні теплішали і розтанули, як крига навесні, бо Любов до <nobr>ворогів —</nobr> величезний фактор, і для Бога ніщо не є неможливим!</p>

            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Віруючі,</span>&nbsp ваші домівки — на високих опушках! Кожний перехожий бачить, чи палає у вашій домівці Світло Любові! Якщо ваші серця не палають Любов'ю, не забувайте, що віра мертва без справ! (<a href="https://www.bible.com/uk/bible/1755/JAS.2.26">Якова, 2:26</a>) Бо якщо віруючі охолонуть в Любові, перестануть світити, що користі від їхніх переконань? Не вгашайте Божого Духа! Любов вашу не заховати у серці, не зробити Її одноосібною, виключно персональною; Вона як тисячі сонць промениста! Будьте між собою єдині в Любові, допомагайте нужденним, будьте іншим опорою, несіть Божу звістку, проповідуйте Боже Слово! Будьте як жива виноградна галузка на Виноградній Лозі (якою є Христос), що приносить рясний урожай!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Проповідуйте Боже Слово,</span>&nbsp щоби інші повірили не просто словам, а побачили вашу чесність, турботу, пробачливість! Ваше чуйне, добре серце підкріплює всі слова <span class="basicTextDescribed" data-tooltip-text='"Добра Звістка"'>Євангелія</span>, що ви мовите для свого оточення! Ваша відданість, ваша непохитна чесність, ваша доброта — золота печатка вашого кожного слова! Не соромтеся бути голосом Божим серед невіруючих!

			<p><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Ісус</span>&nbsp добрий настільки, що прощає тим, хто впокорився духом, будь-який гріх із радістю, бо спасіння <nobr>грішників —</nobr> Щастя для Нього!</p>
            
			<p><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Ісус</span>&nbsp подбав про те, щоби ми знали все, що нам треба, і через дві тисячі років!</p>
            
			<p><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Ісус</span>&nbsp обітре кожну сльозу з очей!</p>

			<p><span class=handwrittenTextLight>Ісус</span><span class=handwrittenText> зробив для нас Усе.</span></p>

            <p><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Бог</span>&nbsp не створив людину для тимчасового життя, що закінчується смертю, але саму смерть зробив тимчасовістю; людину же створив для вічного життя, бажаючи розділити з творінням Всю Радість, і послав Свого Сина у світ, щоби Він примирив із Ним кожне творіння, яке не є досконалим, щоби і недосконалі творіння, очищені кров'ю Христа і освячені Духом, могли жити вічно, як діти Божі, щоби щира Любов була в усьому і Усе — у Любові!</p>

            <p><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Бог</span>&nbsp є <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Духом</span>&nbsp і кожний, хто війде у вічне життя, має народитися <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Духом від Бога!</span></p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Найбільший індикатор,</span>&nbsp що людина народилась від Бога: <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>щиросердечна Любов,</span>&nbsp Яку ми знаємо по Її добрим плодам!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Та Біблія вчить,</span>&nbsp що одного цього недостатньо, щоби отримати спасіння! На прикладі сотника Корнилія (<a href="https://www.bible.com/uk/bible/1755/ACT.10">Книга Дій, 10</a>), він мав щиру Любов і щедро допомагав людям милостинню! Але Бог послав Свого ангела, щоби проповідувати Йому про Ісуса Христа і охрестити його, щоби він і його родина, всі отримали спасіння!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Бог</span>&nbsp чітко стверджує, що "потрібно народитися від <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Духа</span>&nbsp і <span class=basicTextBlue>води</span>" (<a href="https://www.bible.com/uk/bible/1755/JHN.3.5">Івана, 3:5</a>), тобто охреститися і <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Духом Святим,</span>&nbsp і <span class=basicTextBlue>водою!</span> Бог хрестить нас <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Духом Святим,</span>&nbsp і ми знаємо, що ми охрещені <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Духом,</span>&nbsp коли маємо Божу Любов всередині нас! А Любов ми знаємо по плодам: Доброта, Милосердя, Пробачливість, Вірність, Відданість, Ласкавість, Терпіння, Радість, Ніжність! Ми не вказуємо Богові, коли і кого хрестити Духом, але наша відповідальність, як кожного віруючого — охреститися водою! Як до сотника Корнилія прийшов ангел, щоби розповісти це, так і це повідомлення — для вас, щоби ви прийняли хрещення і мали спасіння!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Щоби</span>&nbsp хрещення було максимально наближеним до того, як хрестила Перша Церква, хреститися треба повним зануренням у воду, бо занурення символізує погребіння старого життя з усіма його гріхами, а винурення — відродження у новому житті з Богом!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Знайте,</span>&nbsp що приймаючи хрещення, ви складаєте завіт із Богом, і це є відповідальністю, бо ви даєте обіцянку Богові, що від нині прагнутимите жити у <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Божому Світлі,</span>&nbsp не вгашаючи <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Божого Духа,</span>&nbsp не ховаючи свій світильник, у добрих ділах, турботі і увазі до інших!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Кожне хрещення</span>&nbsp — це свідомий акт віри, покаяння і є відповідальністю!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>А тому</span>&nbsp ми (Церква Христова) не маємо жодного авторитету, щоби стверджувати, що хрещення в дитинстві (коли вас хрестили зовсім малечею) достатньо для вашого спасіння, бо Біблія не вчить, що можна хрестити маленьких дітей: без проповіді, без належних знань, без підтвердження віри, без покаяння, без розуміння відповідальності, без згоди! Ісус ніколи не закликав, щоби хрестити маленьких дітей, а заповідав: <span class=handwrittenText>"Навчайте і хрестіть!",</span>&nbsp щоби спершу проповідувати, а потім хрестити на основі віри!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Кожний,</span>&nbsp хто був хрещений у дитинстві, задумайтесь: чи ви прийняли хрещення, як описане в Біблії? Зі знанням, з вірою, з покаянням, з відповідальністю. Неважливо, якої ви конфесії, чи православний, чи католік, чи греко-католік, центр вашої віри — Ісус Христос і джерело вашої віри — Боже Слово! Довіряйте не цьому текстові, а довіряйте Божому Слову: Біблії, яка збережена тисячоліття, а Біблія описує хрещення як свідомий акт віри з покаянням і відповідальністю!</p>

            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Знайте,</span>&nbsp що для хрещення немає вікових обмежень. І немає нічого дивного в тому, щоби охреститися у старому віці!</p>
            
            <p><span class=handwrittenText>Хай</span>&nbsp кожного читача мудрістю благословить <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Бог</span>&nbsp і серце його хай сповнює <span class=handwrittenTextLightSoft>Любов!</span></p>
